POINTERS

pointers are memory addresses

void* ptr=0; or NULL or nullptr

int var=8;

to get the address of var we write: void* ptr=&var; and now ptr has the address of var;

to change the value of var we need to use types instead of void we use int* ptr=&var;

and then we can change it: *ptr =10; and now var equals 10;
